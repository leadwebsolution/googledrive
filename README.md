# Google Drive downloader !

Create direct download link for all your google drives files without google API to bypass the rate limit.

Actual issue to fix : direct video download link work on VLC desktop but not on VLC mobile (android) it's probably a problem of VLC but i found a fix we need to put the download link in an URL shortner (tested and worked with bit.ly) but as there API also have rate limit i prefered to not doing it , if someone know a  shortner service with higher limits please answer to the issue or create a pull request.
